UglySTM32 is an environment for development STM32 microcontroller with CMSIS only. No HAL & LL.Just CMSIS & Makefile!
Focus on STM32F4xx (STM32F411) because it's cheap :). UglySTM32 is a fork from https://github.com/STM32-base 
Just to make it simple, clean, & ugly :)

The structure :

UglySTM32
	|
	|base---|linker-----------|STM32F4xx -->STM32F4*.ld
	|	|make ------------|STM32F4xx -->common.mk			
	|	|startup ---------|STM32F4xx -->STM32F4*.s
	|
	|cmsis--|ARM-------|inc
	| 	|STM32F4xx-|inc--->STM32F4*.h
	|		   |src--->system_*.c 	
	|libraries
	|
	|projects|yourproject--|bin
	|		       |obj	
	|		       |src-->Makefile & main.c 	
	|			   
	|tools--|arm-none-eabi 
		|bin
		|lib
		|share
		
git clone https://github.com/michaeldaranto/UglySTM32.git 
Change directory name from UglySTM32 to potatoguy if you want it! 
Download gcc-arm-none-eabi & extract at tools folder.
	https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
CD to your src project and type "make" to compile the source code & "make flash" to flashing the stm32 chip. 
Clean your dirty room with "make clean". This command will trash your *.o, *.bin, and *.elf. 
Hack common.md file at /base/make to make it more ugly ;)
If you want more!
	Go to https://github.com/STMicroelectronics
	Download CMSIS version of your F1 or F7 chip. Exa https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_f7
	Extract and copy to cmsis folder
	Go to https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base
	Download linker, make, & startup --> STM32F7xx
	Copy all STM32F7xx directory to UglySTM32 (don't kill UglySTM32 common.md file at /base/make) 
Now..You are set to go!
